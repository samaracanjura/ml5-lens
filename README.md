# Making a Reverse Engineered Snap Lense

What it intels: 
This snap filter was created using Photoshop, p5.js and ml5 

I used Photoshop to draw the filter such as the different leaves and their colors and placements. 
I changed the p5.js file to place the filter on the points of the forehead and it would track the points as you move along the camera. For the element I chose to track the distance between the point of the upper low and the point of the lower lip, if those two points created a distance bigger than 10 then an image of freckles and stars will appear on your cheeks and across the nose. That image of freckles is to stay there and track the points of the nose, left cheek and right cheek and move along with you as you move your face around the camera. In order to remove the filter off the cheeks and nose you will have to click anywhere you want along the image surface.
